# HANDWRITTEN-DIGIT-RECOGNITION-USING-KNN
Train your model using K-Nearest Neighbor Algorithm with having values of K as {2,4,5,6,7,10}, over data.csv file provided. The Train and Test split of the data should be in the ratio of 60:40, 70:30, 75:25, 80:20, 90:10, 95:5. Evaluate the performance of the model over test data for all these scenarios (36 cases)
